Their excuse was that "I wasn''t communicating often" even though I replied to each of their questions immediately. So I left and dropped the project.

    - Led the development of a client project from the ground up, handling backend, Android, and web front-ends single-handedly.
    - The app gained around 1000 monthly active users within a year, reaching 50k+ users in 6 months with an average Play Store rating of 4.7 out of 5.
    - In July 2016, due to a breach of contract, I filed a copyright request, leading Google to take down the app. I later released it when the client settled and purchased the app’s IP entirely.

  description: It is a highly secure online repository to keep medical records. Medical records could be X-ray, MRI, CT scans, history of medicines prescribed, patient details or even medical instruments used in surgery and diagnosis. These are generalised as a "prop" which is associated with a prop ID. Regardless of what kind it is, a simple QR code can be used to identify these props using the ID. The code can even be stuck on the actual prop in the form of QR sticker. Depending on what prop is chosen, appropriate data is fetched and displayed correctly on the app. Using such a general pattern is useful as it helps determine what kind of action must be taken and what sort of data can be displayed. And since the database is globally accessible the doctor can access the data from anywhere in the world. Since all mobile phone, these days are equipped with a camera they can read these QR codes and get the details.

  description: "Portable Data Protection System (PDPS) is a new concept of security systems that help to protect computers from malware attacks. Unlike conventional anti – virus systems that scan entire systems periodically against its malware signature database and cause the systems to slow down and hang up (due to over usage of processor cycles), this system uses just- in-time detection to prevent malware attacks right whenever a new process or thread begins. It uses ACLs instead of a database of malware definition files like most AVs do to ensure only the processes that the user wants to run are allowed to run. Everything else is considered as malware. The end product was put into a read-only pen drive which runs the autorun script requesting user whether they would like to enable PDPS protection. Since it's read-only, it's not possible for the system itself to get infected making this a versatile solution to fight malware.\n\nDeveloped a portable, robust yet powerful real-time anti-virus system which prevented malware before they got processor execution cycles, thereby preventing the execution of malicious code it may contain. The system was programmed to hook into the operating system's loader code and ensure that all requests (system calls) are filtered thro' it, very much like a firewall--it even prompted the user whether to allow execution of any given program leading to a more refined control over what was allowed to run in the device. Since most malware tend to get into the system in the background attached to a legitimate file or trigger due to a user action the system could alert the user to make the right decisions. A moderately intelligent user would be able to judge that said process was never initiated by the user and so all malware infections would be intercepted and suppressed. This system does not require any definition files nor updates and could even by run on thin clients making it very less resource-hungry (unlike most conventional AVs out there in the market) and at the same time enforce strong security to the user's system.\n\nMy team wrote this program as an autorun program to a pen drive which came with a read-only switch. Therefore, the system itself was protected from being infected and was allowed to do it's good work. A more commercial permanently written portable pen drive kind of anti-virus too can be developed based on this concept. The project was developed as an application level program (using C#.NET form-based application) rather than as a kernel level driver (which would be more stronger as it even prevented bootkits) and was successfully presented as a final year project.\n\nI later submitted the underlying concept as a paper which got approved and published in a journal in Special Issue-1, October 2014 with ISSN 2321-9653."

  description: "Nyquist (or) MKB Music box (named after the initials of the team members) is a media organiser which can identify music using the audio signature like Shazam does and organises it into folders based on the user preference. The project was originally built for Softkriti, an IIT-K software contest and Shazam being a closed-source software, I had to build the technology from scratch. Internally, it used something called fast fourier transform to calculate the audio signature and store a hash of it inside a database. We had to do this on several songs and we added ID3 tags for the song as well. Later using the client app, a folder containing songs is selected the system automatically figures out which song is it by calculating and comparing this signature with the database. The software worked perfectly and was super fast since we ran the global DB locally but we did not win the contest and came in 3rd (apparently). The winners were both IIT-K students for some sample projects of some platforms which were popular back then. The project was dropped since.\n"
