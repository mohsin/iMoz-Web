I'm Mohsin, a freelance full-stack developer based out of Bangalore, India. I specialize in building web, mobile, voice, and watch apps, seamlessly translating designs into pixel-perfect applications. The best part? I single-handedly code the backend, frontend, and server setup (DevOps, CI/CD pipeline). My expertise lies in native Android development (using Kotlin) and web development with Laravel.

Apart from coding, I also engage in public speaking and occasionally conduct workshops to educate students. Additionally, I volunteer to teach English to underprivileged children at an NGO. I enjoy working with open-source code, which you can find on GitHub. My hobbies include singing at karaoke, playing the guitar, swimming, reading novels, skating, food tasting, and occasionally playing football, badminton, and cooking.
